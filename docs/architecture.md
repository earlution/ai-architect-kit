# Architectural Principles

## Core Design Philosophy
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Testability

## Architectural Patterns
### 1. Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Dependency rule
- Independent of frameworks
- Testable by design

### 2. Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules independent of low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions
- Reduces coupling
- Enhances flexibility

### 3. Domain-Driven Design
- Focus on core business logic
- Ubiquitous language
- Bounded contexts
- Model-driven design

## Implementation Guidelines
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Design for extension, not modification
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Ensure robust error handling

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading
- Efficient memory management
- Minimal computational complexity
- Horizontal scalability

## Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Coupling and cohesion
- Test coverage
- Performance benchmarks
