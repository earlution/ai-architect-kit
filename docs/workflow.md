# Development Workflow

## Issue-Driven Development
1. **Issue Selection**
   - Choose single, well-defined issue
   - Understand full context
   - Clarify acceptance criteria

2. **Development Cycle**
   - Create/update tests
   - Implement solution
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Refactor if necessary

3. **Code Review Process**
   - Peer review mandatory
   - AI-assisted review recommended
   - Address all feedback

## Version Control Practices
- Use feature branches
- Meaningful commit messages
- Squash commits before merge
- Maintain clean git history

## Continuous Integration
- Automated testing
- Static code analysis
- Security vulnerability checks
- Performance benchmarking

## Deployment Strategy
- Staged rollout
- Feature flagging
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Rollback capabilities

## Documentation Standards
- Update docs with each feature
- Maintain changelog
- Document architectural decisions
- Provide clear code comments

## Quality Checkpoints
- Test coverage > 80%
- No critical static analysis warnings
- Performance within defined thresholds
- Accessibility compliance
