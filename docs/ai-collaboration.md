# AI Collaboration Guidelines

## Fundamental Principles
- Architect remains primary decision-maker
- AI serves as implementation partner
- Maintain critical thinking and review all AI-generated content

## Effective Interaction Strategies
### 1. Request Clarity
- Provide detailed, specific context
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Specify desired output format

### 2. Iterative Refinement
- Break complex tasks into smaller components
- Review and validate AI-generated code
- Incrementally improve solutions

### 3. Quality Control
- Always run comprehensive tests
- Manually review AI-generated implementations
- Verify alignment with project standards

## AI Request Templates
### Code Generation
```markdown
Context:
- Project goal:
- Specific requirements:
- Constraints:
- Expected input/output:

Request:
Generate [specific component/function] that:
- Adheres to [language] best practices
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle
- Includes error handling
- Provides clear documentation
```

### Code Review Request
```markdown
Review Request:
- Attached code:
- Specific areas of concern:
- Desired improvements:
  * Performance
  * Readability
  * Maintainability
```

## Red Flags and Mitigation
- Overly complex solutions
- Potential performance bottlenecks
- Non-standard or unclear implementations
- Lack of proper error handling

## Continuous Learning
- Document effective AI collaboration patterns
- Share successful interaction strategies
- Regularly update collaboration guidelines
