# Testing Strategy

## Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Individual component testing
   - Quick execution
   - High coverage
   - Verify specific behaviours

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component interaction
   - Validate system modules
   - Ensure proper integration
   - Test boundary conditions

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Full system scenarios
   - Simulate real-world usage
   - Validate complete workflows
   - Performance assessment

## Testing Principles
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Isolation of test cases
- Deterministic outcomes
- Minimal external dependencies

## Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Branch coverage > 75%
- Mutation testing
- Code path analysis

## Continuous Testing
- Automated test suites
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD integration
- Periodic stress testing

## Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Scalability assessment
- Benchmark comparisons

## Security Testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Dependency checks
- Input validation

## Reporting
- Detailed test reports
- Trend analysis
- Quick failure identification
- Performance metrics
