# AI Architect Kit

A professional framework for architects and engineers working with AI programming assistants.

## Overview

AI Architect Kit provides a structured approach for software architects and engineers to effectively collaborate with AI programming assistants. It emphasizes clean architecture, atomic design principles, and proven patterns for maintaining software quality while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Core Principles

- **You are the Architect**: AI is your implementation partner, you make the design decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and component boundaries
- **Atomic Design**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Quality First**: Strong emphasis on testing, documentation, and maintainable code
